# hello-world
My name is Sherry and I am a software engineer.  I live in San Diego.  

I have experience in all aspects of the software product development lifestyle.  In the past I used C, C++, Visual Basic, and other languages.  Now I am taking a course from UCSD in Java programming.  

Nice to meet you.
